#Features

1. The chessBoard is implemented using a map. This is so that the chessBoard boxes can have values of 
    their neighbors where the knight can move to.

2. The chessBoard graph of the knight movements is implemented using an adjacency list.

3. (2) above is implemtned by the addEdges() function.

4. The knight movement is implemented using the Breadth First Search (BFS) to find the shallowest route in the graph.
    the working queue used in the BFS is an array of the current vertex and the path taken to reach it.
